# Handoff: battlecode26b-vibe

Clean-room 2026 redo (see PROMPTS.md #1 for the rules: no reading 2026 post-mortems, nothing from the original
battlecode26-vibe except running its bot as an opponent, competitor code is scanned for safety and never read).

## Where things are
- `bots/ratbot/` is the dev bot; `bots/s0*` are frozen snapshots (`tools/snapshot.sh NAME`). Behaviour switches are in `Cfg.java`.
  - `King`: spawn (a core of 12 always, more on projected income (`Econ`), freely at war), rat traps at war,
    symmetry, comms.
  - `Baby`: gather/deliver, cat fighting and cat traps, war mode (bite targeting, ratnap and throw, rat traps,
    anti-ratnap facing), optional `Micro` (scored combat movement) and rush role (`Cfg.RUSH`).
  - `Nav`: greedy plus bug, digs dirt.
- `test/ratbot/BotTest.java` holds the bot unit tests (fake RobotController). `tools/test_tools.py` tests the tooling.
  `tools/unit-tests.sh` runs both, after every change.
- Running games:
  - `tools/arena.py` (game/matrix) and `tools/cells.py`.
  - `tools/gauntlet.py` (field cells/table, from `research/field/FIELD.tsv`).
  - `tools/game_report.py` (basics report, `--timeline N`), `tools/rows.py`.
  - `tools/battle_report.py` (combat: front line, HP loss by cause, grabs and their fate, throw damage, cheese per window).
- Progress (laid out like battlecode23-vibe's `progress/`): `tools/progress-refresh.sh` pulls VM `runs/*/results.jsonl` and replica matches into `progress/games.csv`, then writes ELO.md + elo.png + ratings.csv (Bradley-Terry, `tools/elo.py`: local games count their points share, our-vs-field games carry a per-map handicap so builds gauntleted on different maps compare), ladder.md/png and rating-history.md/png (replica, `tools/replica_report.py`), progress.png (bc23 layout: our builds' rating +- 95% and expected field score in date order, adopted builds filled) and metrics.png (raw gauntlet metrics from `research/progress.tsv`) (`tools/plot_progress.py`) and ATTEMPTS.md (`tools/attempts.py render` from the hand-kept `progress/attempts.csv`; `attempts.py init` adds new snapshots, `attempts.py set NAME outcome=...` records verdicts). Run it after each gauntlet and commit progress/.
- VM: `source tools/vm.sh && ensure_vm && vm_sync`. All volume games run on battlecode-dev.
  - Local games use `BC_SLOTS` up to 6.
  - The replica uses 2 slots (`/etc/bc26-galaxy/local.env`).
- Replica ladder: `tools/galaxy26/` (ACCESS.md).
  - `contest.py submit` uploads `bots/ratbot` as team vibe26b.
  - `field.py status|queue|rate`.
  - The activity and autoscrim timers are ON.

## TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md, this season (step -> tool; gaps marked GAP)
- Rules digest: `RULES.md` (engine-cited). Compute is a deterministic bytecode count (baby 17500, king 20000 per
  turn; overrun = debt), plus a 1200 s team CPU cap per game: every local overrun is a real defect.
- Map corpus: `maps/`, `research/maps.tsv`, `bc26tools.MapCensus` (`--ascii NAME`). Runner: `tools/arena.py`
  (headless, seeded, one row per game in `runs/RUN/results.jsonl`). Replay reader: `tools/game_report.py`,
  `tools/battle_report.py`, `g0.turns.tsv` / `g0.actions.tsv` from `arena.py game --tsv`.
- Decision tags: the indicator string (`Debug.java`): babies `mv=` move reason, `dg` digs, `fl` flow, `df` defends,
  `EXC=n:type@stage`; king `km=` mine-walk reason (m walk, D dug, x cooldown, y cheese, z no dirt-only step, e/c enemy
  or cat seen, a arrived), `hm` home mine, `kd` king digs.
- Snapshot: `tools/snapshot.sh NAME` (bots/NAME + SNAPSHOT with source hash and a reason line).
- Field bots: `~/projects/vibe/bc26b-benchmarks` (scanned, source unread), `research/field/FIELD.tsv`.
- **Cell score** (`tools/score.py`, used by gauntlet/games/elo): 100/0 to the winner when kings decide a game, else
  the spec's points share. Before 2026-10-28 08:28 (milestone M3) screens used `arena.points`, whose "kings" share
  read the replay's kingsA/kingsB aggregate, which is 10 * global cheese + kings: a king-kill loss scored ~25-45 for
  cat damage and leftover cheese. Every score is now recomputed from the raw fields, old runs included.
- **Field bots play only on the replica** (owner, PROMPTS #8; milestone M4, 2026-10-28 08:50): every game against a
  downloaded bot is a replica scrimmage under its hourly limits (40 unranked + 20 ranked requests), as for a contestant.
  Local games (VM `arena.py matrix`, driver diagnostics) are our builds against each other, archetypes and the stock
  players only. Before M4 every local screen (g1-g7 top-6, b1 band) and diagnostic (dm*, cf*) ran field bots locally;
  `tools/elo.py` now ignores those games (`--local-field` brings them back) and progress.png shows accepted builds only.
  Field-bot diagnostics now come from downloaded scrimmage replays (`contest.py fetch`, then `game_report.py` /
  `econ_report.py` / `battle_report.py` on the .bc26).
- **Request queue**: `contest.py scrim ... --queue research/panel/queue.tsv` keeps what the limit refuses, tagged with
  the active build; `tools/galaxy26/drain-loop.sh` (nohup on the driver, log `build/drain.log`, stop with
  `touch build/drain.stop`) runs `contest.py drain` every 5 min and sends only rows of the active build.
- **Local screen (rejects only)**: paired self-play vs the incumbent, `research/screen/self1-maps.txt` (40 random maps)
  x both sides, seed 0: `runs/spN_NAME` on the VM (cells `build/spN_NAME.tsv`), scored by `gauntlet.py selfplay
  RUN/results.jsonl --base s2o`: candidate's cell score minus 50, paired t; reject at t <= -1.5. The identity
  control `s2o_id` came out exactly 0 (identical code replays the same game with sides swapped), so no control run.
- **Bytecode tag (replays without indicator strings)**: since 13:20 on 10-28 every build pads its turn so that the
  turn's bytecode count mod 128 is a 7-bit tag (Debug.tag, TAG_K 12 calibrated: 0 misses in 14954 local turns).
  Bits 0-4 are the baby's move code (Baby.why) or the king's spawn code (King.spawnWhy: n s f c b d), bit 5 a
  fighter or a king with enemies in view, bit 6 parity. `tools/smuggle.py REPLAY [--game N]` tells tagged teams from
  untagged ones (parity pass rate) and counts decisions per team. Builds before s3y carry no tag.
- Economy report: `tools/econ_report.py TSVDIR|REPLAY [--hi R]` (each cheese pile from spawn to pickup: per mine its
  side, cheese spawned, taken by each team, wait, rat-rounds within 4, left on the ground; per team own/enemy/middle/
  drops and cheese lost on its own side). `--team vibe26b --hi 200 R1.bc26 R2.bc26 ...` sums every game by mine side
  (own / enemy / middle) for field-wide comparisons on replica replays.
- **Ladder panel (accepts)**: replica, `tools/galaxy26/contest.py`. Panel v2 = 8 field bots s2o beat 25-75% in
  calibration (`tools/panel_pick.py s2o` on games.csv; plus C0derTang_v6 5/6 and bestsofar 1/6 at the edges), 3 maps
  each, both sides: set 1 `research/panel/v2-set1.json` (s2o's reference matches `v2-set1-ref-s2o.txt`, from the
  calibration and v1 games), set 2 `v2-set2.json` (maps drawn as the requests go out; s2o's control queued). 48 games
  a set. Candidate: submit it, `contest.py scrim --vs NAME@+,NAME@-,... --panel research/panel/v2-setN.json --queue
  research/panel/queue.tsv`, re-submit the incumbent; `contest.py fetch --new --pages 30`, then `contest.py paired
  REF_IDS CAND_IDS` (win/loss per cell; accept at t >= 2 with D >= 4, blocks 1-3 reject at t <= 0 / 1 / 1.5).
  GAP: graded (points) score from panel replays; autoscrim can pair us while a candidate is active.
- Ratings and progress: `tools/progress-refresh.sh` (see above); milestones `tools/milestones.py add LABEL`.
- Records: `TRAINING_LOG.md` (per attempt), `progress/attempts.csv` (`attempts.py set NAME outcome=...`),
  `research/progress.tsv` (gauntlet metrics), `PROMPTS.md`. GAP: closed-directions ledger is the attempts outcomes.

## State (see TRAINING_LOG.md for the history)
- Incumbent on the replica: s2o (submission #62). s3h (#63) was rejected on panel v2 (t 0.58). s3y (#64) = s3t
  behaviour (s3h + MINE_BALANCE) + the bytecode tag; its panel v2 blocks (sets 1 and 2) are queued in
  research/panel/queue.tsv and the drain loop sends them under the hourly limit. Score with
  `contest.py paired research/panel/v2-ref-s2o.txt SET1_IDS SET2_IDS`, then re-submit s2o if s3y is rejected.
- Dev = s3h behaviour plus off-by-default switches: KING_DODGE + YIELD_KING, HUNGRY, CARRY_MAX, BITE_GUARD,
  BITE_CARRIER, MINE_BALANCE, RICH_BABIES, FORM_KING (FORM_MAX). Debug.TAG is on (no behaviour change).
- Field diagnosis: combat with the top 10 is even; the loss is collection (fixed locally by MINE_BALANCE: s3t picks
  14-141% more cheese to r300) and kings. In 12 of 21 round-2000 losses the opponent had 2-5 kings to our 1; the
  top bots form king 2 at r150-650. s3v (FORM_KING) forms kings but was neutral on self-play (-0.6) with king
  deaths 9 vs 2: forming at FORM_CHEESE 300 likely starves poor maps. Next: a bank+income gate, then a tagged king
  variant for the replica.
- VM queue (serial, ~20 min each): sp8 s3w (MINE_BALANCE + RICH_BABIES 30 + FORM_KING) -> sp9 s3x (s3w +
  FORM_MAX 4) -> sp4 s3n -> sp6 s3r -> sp3 s3m -> sp5 s3o/s3p/s3q. Controls: s3w vs sp7_s3t, s3x vs sp8_s3w, s3n/s3m
  vs sp2_s3i, s3r/s3o/s3p/s3q vs sp2_s3h.
- Against examplefuncsplayer (all 74 maps, both sides): v0d won 134-14.
