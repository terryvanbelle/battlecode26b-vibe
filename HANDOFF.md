# Handoff: battlecode26b-vibe

Clean-room 2026 redo (see PROMPTS.md #1 for the rules: no reading 2026 post-mortems, nothing from the original
battlecode26-vibe except running its bot as an opponent, competitor code is scanned for safety and never read).

## Where things are
- `bots/ratbot/` is the dev bot; `bots/s0*` are frozen snapshots (`tools/snapshot.sh NAME`). Behaviour switches are in `Cfg.java`.
  - `King`: spawn (a core of 12 always, more on projected income (`Econ`), freely at war), rat traps at war,
    symmetry, comms.
  - `Baby`: gather/deliver, cat fighting and cat traps, war mode (bite targeting, ratnap and throw, rat traps,
    anti-ratnap facing), optional `Micro` (scored combat movement) and rush role (`Cfg.RUSH`).
  - `Nav`: greedy plus bug, digs dirt.
- `test/ratbot/BotTest.java` holds the bot unit tests (fake RobotController). `tools/test_tools.py` tests the tooling.
  `tools/unit-tests.sh` runs both, after every change.
- Running games:
  - `tools/arena.py` (game/matrix) and `tools/cells.py`.
  - `tools/gauntlet.py` (field cells/table, from `research/field/FIELD.tsv`).
  - `tools/game_report.py` (basics report, `--timeline N`), `tools/rows.py`.
  - `tools/battle_report.py` (combat: front line, HP loss by cause, grabs and their fate, throw damage, cheese per window).
    It takes a .bc26, a dump directory or a replica match directory (MATCHDIR, dumped from its replay.bc26; side
    reversal read from the match.json beside it). Trap keys: `placed` = `hit` + `removed` + `live` for traps placed
    in the window, `fired` = triggers in the window; throwOut `kills` counts rats, `killsKing` kings. An empty
    window prints only the header.
  - `tools/king_report.py [--json] REPLAY` (per king: died, deathCause, starveHp, hpBy incl. `ownThrow`/`ownThrowHits`,
    firstFoe, broke). `game_report.py` rows carry `bc`; `tags` is null for an untagged team; the timeline has kings
    columns.
  - `tools/java/bc26tools/ReplayDump.java`, dumpVersion 3 (2026-10-28 audit round 2): trap victims by the engine's
    footprint rule, starvation booked only when the bank is surely below 2 (else the hp goes to the biter as boosted
    bite), summary mode exits 1 on a parse failure, meta `file` absolute. Known gap: a king that starves on the turn
    it forms is not booked (never seen).
  - `tools/stuck_report.py SRC... [--team NAME] [--span 30]`: stuck babies from the tag: travel code (d, M, C) on
    every turn inside a 3x3 box for 30+ rounds; lost rounds by code, longest episodes with the distance to the nearest
    own king (2 = touching its body). s4d baseline on runs/diag_stuck1 (5 maps vs s2o): 105 episodes, 7295 rounds.
    `arena.py game A B MAP --keep --tsv --out DIR` keeps indicator strings (fl=builds:done:turns:steps).
- Progress (laid out like battlecode23-vibe's `progress/`): `tools/progress-refresh.sh` pulls VM `runs/*/results.jsonl` and replica matches into `progress/games.csv`, then writes ELO.md + elo.png + ratings.csv (Bradley-Terry, `tools/elo.py`: local games count their points share, our-vs-field games carry a per-map handicap so builds gauntleted on different maps compare), ladder.md/png and rating-history.md/png (replica, `tools/replica_report.py`), progress.png (bc23 layout: our builds' rating +- 95% and expected field score in date order, adopted builds filled) and metrics.png (raw gauntlet metrics from `research/progress.tsv`) (`tools/plot_progress.py`) and ATTEMPTS.md (`tools/attempts.py render` from the hand-kept `progress/attempts.csv`; `attempts.py init` adds new snapshots, `attempts.py set NAME outcome=...` records verdicts). Run it after each gauntlet and commit progress/.
- VM: `source tools/vm.sh && ensure_vm && vm_sync`. All volume games run on battlecode-dev.
  - Local games use `BC_SLOTS` up to 6.
  - The replica uses 2 slots (`/etc/bc26-galaxy/local.env`).
- Replica ladder: `tools/galaxy26/` (ACCESS.md).
  - `contest.py submit` uploads `bots/ratbot` as team vibe26b.
  - `field.py status|queue|rate`.
  - The activity and autoscrim timers are ON.

## TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md, this season (step -> tool; gaps marked GAP)
- Rules digest: `RULES.md` (engine-cited). Compute is a deterministic bytecode count (baby 17500, king 20000 per
  turn; overrun = debt), plus a 1200 s team CPU cap per game: every local overrun is a real defect.
- Map corpus: `maps/`, `research/maps.tsv`, `bc26tools.MapCensus` (`--ascii NAME`). Runner: `tools/arena.py`
  (headless, seeded, one row per game in `runs/RUN/results.jsonl`). Replay reader: `tools/game_report.py`,
  `tools/battle_report.py`, `g0.turns.tsv` / `g0.actions.tsv` from `arena.py game --tsv`.
- Decision tags: the indicator string (`Debug.java`): babies `mv=` move reason, `dg` digs, `fl` flow, `df` defends,
  `EXC=n:type@stage`; king `km=` mine-walk reason (m walk, D dug, x cooldown, y cheese, z no dirt-only step, e/c enemy
  or cat seen, a arrived), `hm` home mine, `kd` king digs.
- Snapshot: `tools/snapshot.sh NAME` (bots/NAME + SNAPSHOT with source hash and a reason line).
- Field bots: `~/projects/vibe/bc26b-benchmarks` (scanned, source unread), `research/field/FIELD.tsv`.
- **Cell score** (`tools/score.py`, used by gauntlet/games/elo): 100/0 to the winner when kings decide a game, else
  the spec's points share. Before 2026-10-28 08:28 (milestone M3) screens used `arena.points`, whose "kings" share
  read the replay's kingsA/kingsB aggregate, which is 10 * global cheese + kings: a king-kill loss scored ~25-45 for
  cat damage and leftover cheese. Every score is now recomputed from the raw fields, old runs included.
- **Field bots play only on the replica** (owner, PROMPTS #8; milestone M4, 2026-10-28 08:50): every game against a
  downloaded bot is a replica scrimmage under its hourly limits (40 unranked + 20 ranked requests), as for a contestant.
  Local games (VM `arena.py matrix`, driver diagnostics) are our builds against each other, archetypes and the stock
  players only. Before M4 every local screen (g1-g7 top-6, b1 band) and diagnostic (dm*, cf*) ran field bots locally;
  `tools/elo.py` now ignores those games (`--local-field` brings them back) and progress.png shows accepted builds only.
  Field-bot diagnostics now come from downloaded scrimmage replays (`contest.py fetch`, then `game_report.py` /
  `econ_report.py` / `battle_report.py` on the .bc26).
- **Request queue**: `contest.py scrim ... --queue research/panel/queue.tsv` keeps what the limit refuses, tagged with
  the active build; `tools/galaxy26/drain-loop.sh` (nohup on the driver, log `build/drain.log`, stop with
  `touch build/drain.stop`) runs `contest.py drain` every 5 min and sends only rows of the active build.
- **Local screen (rejects only)**: paired self-play vs the incumbent, `research/screen/self1-maps.txt` (40 random maps)
  x both sides, seed 0: `runs/spN_NAME` on the VM (cells `build/spN_NAME.tsv`), scored by `gauntlet.py selfplay
  RUN/results.jsonl --base s2o`: candidate's cell score minus 50, paired t; reject at t <= -1.5. The identity
  control `s2o_id` came out exactly 0 (identical code replays the same game with sides swapped), so no control run.
- **Bytecode tag (replays without indicator strings)**: since 13:20 on 10-28 every build pads its turn so that the
  turn's bytecode count mod 128 is a 7-bit tag (Debug.tag, TAG_K 12 calibrated: 0 misses in 14954 local turns).
  Bits 0-4 are the baby's move code (Baby.why) or the king's spawn code (King.spawnWhy: n s f c b d), bit 5 a
  fighter or a king with enemies in view, bit 6 parity. `tools/smuggle.py REPLAY [--game N]` tells tagged teams from
  untagged ones (parity pass rate) and counts decisions per team. Builds before s3y carry no tag.
- Economy report: `tools/econ_report.py TSVDIR|REPLAY [--hi R]` (each cheese pile from spawn to pickup: per mine its
  side, cheese spawned, taken by each team, wait, rat-rounds within 4, left on the ground; per team own/enemy/middle/
  drops and cheese lost on its own side). `--team vibe26b --hi 200 R1.bc26 R2.bc26 ...` sums every game by mine side
  (own / enemy / middle) for field-wide comparisons on replica replays.
- **Ladder panel (accepts)**: replica, `tools/galaxy26/contest.py`. Panel v2 = 8 field bots s2o beat 25-75% in
  calibration (`tools/panel_pick.py s2o` on games.csv; plus C0derTang_v6 5/6 and bestsofar 1/6 at the edges), 3 maps
  each, both sides: set 1 `research/panel/v2-set1.json` (s2o's reference matches `v2-set1-ref-s2o.txt`, from the
  calibration and v1 games), set 2 `v2-set2.json` (maps drawn as the requests go out; s2o's control queued). 48 games
  a set. Candidate: submit it, `contest.py scrim --vs NAME@+,NAME@-,... --panel research/panel/v2-setN.json --queue
  research/panel/queue.tsv`, re-submit the incumbent; `contest.py fetch --new --pages 30`, then `contest.py paired
  REF_IDS CAND_IDS` (win/loss per cell; accept at t >= 2 with D >= 4, blocks 1-3 reject at t <= 0 / 1 / 1.5).
  On every accept (owner rule, PROMPTS.md #16): `attempts.py set NAME "outcome=accepted ..."`, then
  `tools/progress-refresh.sh`, then commit progress/ and push, before the next candidate goes out.
  `contest.py paired --graded` scores each game by its graded score instead of won (field_report: 1/0 when kings
  decide, else our points share), cached in `<id>/graded.json` with the dumper hash and score version.
  `field_report --builds` names the build per match; rows.py marks rows whose tools changed (`tools_warning`, TOOLS);
  mirror_check exits 2 when a dump fails (cats not counted). GAP: autoscrim can pair us while a candidate is active.
- Ratings and progress: `tools/progress-refresh.sh` (see above); milestones `tools/milestones.py add LABEL`.
- Records: `TRAINING_LOG.md` (per attempt), `progress/attempts.csv` (`attempts.py set NAME outcome=...`),
  `research/progress.tsv` (gauntlet metrics), `PROMPTS.md`. GAP: closed-directions ledger is the attempts outcomes.

## State (2026-11-06 01:07 PST; TRAINING_LOG.md has the history, older states are in this file's git history)
- Incumbent: **u6x** (accepted 2026-11-03 09:21 PST over u6a; pooled 93 cells D 5, net +5, t +2.24). Candidates
  descend from u9p = u6x + CAT_LAY + CAT_RING + TRAP_SHARE false (rejected at block 3, pooled t 1.18), each one
  switch screened against u9p's zd61. **z0g = u9p + PEACE_FROM 100** is on the replica (#235): block 1 (set 3,
  17426-17441) D 10 (+7 -3), net +4, t 1.26, transfer 4,359 (floor 3,968), 0 openings at r100+. Set-1 block 2 after
  match 17441, waiter build/wait_z0gb2.sh; score with `paired 12771-12813 IDS --crown 11549-11677` and
  `research/audits/blockcheck.py ~/diag26b/z0gb2.jsonl,~/diag26b/rp_games.jsonl IDS 12771-12813` (floor 4,133);
  pool blocks as t = (net1 + net2) / sqrt(D1 + D2) (block 2 rejects at t <= 1). Held after passing screens: z0d
  (STAB_LAY, picks z -1.90), z0e (END_CAT 1450).
- Screening (VM queue runs/screenq.txt): zd105 z0m (RETREAT_HP 20), zd106 z0n (END_CAT without gatherers), zd107
  z0p (FACE_REACH), zd108 z0o (BURY, amended stocking), zd109 z0q (RAW_TRAPS: attackers pay rat traps from raw
  cheese they never deliver), zd98/zd97 z0h (FORM_RICH_BANK 1500; zd98 is a mechanism run: `research/audits/
  mech_cmp.py runs/zd98/results.jsonl z0h runs/zd96/results.jsonl u9p`), then the old sweep (zd75 dropped: v0j is
  z0p). Each candidate's falsifiers are in its bots/NAME/SNAPSHOT. Screen transfer gates from z0q on are per round
  on the shared cells: the shared-cell transferAmt gate scored z0l's faster wins as lost delivery (00:50 log).
- Replica scoring (twin-anchored; pass explicit match IDS, others' matches sit in the ranges):
  set 3 `contest.py paired 13248-13291 IDS --crown 12130-12163`; set 1 `paired 12771-12813 IDS --crown 11549-11677`;
  set 2 `paired 12838-12899 IDS --crown 11678-11702`; set 4 `paired 16848-16863 IDS` (u6x reference, 28 of 48).
  Order: sets 3, 1, 2, 4. Block scripts `build/block_v4sN.sh` (they touch research/panel/*.json: `git checkout
  research/panel/` after). IDS: `contest.py matches --pages 8 | awk '$1>LAST && $2=="OK!" && $3=="unranked" &&
  ($4=="vibe26b"||$7=="vibe26b")'`, then `contest.py fetch --new --pages 8`. Transfer floor (u9p family): field_report
  xUs per game >= 0.9x the twin (set 3: 3,968; set 1: 4,133): rsync the 16 match dirs to the VM's ~/diag26b/rp/
  and run `tools/field_report.py games --ids LO-HI --csv` there (never locally: the laptop disk filled at 100%).
- Closed 2026-11-06: z0j (LAY_MAX: mechanism), z0k (FORM_WAR_FROM 300: picks z -3.26), z0l (SIEGE_STAY 20:
  transfer gate 0.952). Closed 2026-11-05/06 on the u9p base: u9q (RETREAT_HP 0: transfer floor), w0b and z0b (inert), w0c (kings
  falsifier after block 2; its replica games replayed u9p's), z0a (RETREAT_CARRY: transfer gate), z0f (END_CAT +
  STAB_LAY: picks z -2.46). The replica is deterministic: a switch that never fires replays its parent's games.
- Local screens (VM): `runs/xt2/cells.tsv` with bots/u5n replaced, `arena.py matrix ... --jobs 3` (~35 min with the
  replica sharing the 8 cores). Score with `build/score_screen.sh RUN BOT [CTRL_RUN CTRL_BOT]`. Controls: zc6 (u6x,
  32 of 44, picks/100 35.56), zd61 (u9p, 38), zd62 (u9q, 40). Basics gate (14:27 rule): overruns/exceptions, picks/100
  below 33.8, D 0. Queue: VM `tools/screenq.sh 3` pops run names from runs/screenq.txt (insert at the front with
  `flock runs/screenq.lock sed -i '1i zdNN' runs/screenq.txt`; cells first: `sed 's#bots/u9q\b#bots/NEW#g'
  runs/zd62/cells.tsv > runs/zdNN/cells.tsv`). Gates: research/screens/gates.tsv, rsynced to VM runs/gates.tsv, read
  every minute by `tools/abort_watch.py runs/gates.tsv --follow` (stops a screen once its wins gate is unreachable).
  Score with `bash tools/score_screen.sh RUN BOT zd61 u9p`. Waiters: `tools/wait_run.sh RUN`; kill by pid only (a
  pkill/pgrep -f once matched the ssh shell).
- VM disk: the replica's replay store grows ~2.4 GB a day; prune replays older than ~36 h by hand (`find ... -mmin
  +2160`, list to /root/bc26-replays-pruned-*.txt) whenever `df -h /` shows under 2 GB free. An hourly root cron for
  this was not installed (the harness denied the persistence; the owner decides).
- Recent evidence (TRAINING_LOG 2026-11-05): u9p's 59 king-kill losses: the last king starved in 34 (after the army
  collapsed), bite 16, throw hits 7; enemy rat traps killed 805 of ours, ours 0. u9q's set-3 fast losses are
  grab-and-throw wars on small maps (tiny vs waxmango: their grabs 108 to our 67, 39% of our grabs ended with our
  carrier grabbed: v1a GRAB_SAFE) and reactive-trap fields (wallsofparadis vs AdamTan12: 74 traps, 72 fired,
  mean life 3.1 rounds, 26 of our rats). Merlin out-farms us 2-3x on FreeTheCheese/cheesebottles.
- Closed on this base: SEEK_CROWD and THROW_ADAPT (u9r, u9s, u9t: picks bar), FORM_RICH_MAX 5 (w0a inert).
  Long closed: PEACE (u3w, u3z, u4l, u6h, u6w), RUSH_TO, RISK_FRESH/RISK_ADAPT, FACE_HOLD, WOUNDED_HP.
- Owner rules: never ask permission to try an idea, never stop trying (PROMPTS #27); never leave the VM idle while
  the replica plays (#28); maps symmetric (#14); refresh and commit progress/ after every accept (#16).
- Local machine: 2 cores, 1 GB RAM, ~1 GB disk free: replay analysis runs on the VM. Volume games run on the VM;
  field bots play only on the replica.
