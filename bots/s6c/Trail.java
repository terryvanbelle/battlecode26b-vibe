 * Breadcrumbs home: the loop-free chain of tiles this baby has walked since it was spawned beside a king. Stepping
 * back onto a tile of the chain cuts off the loop after it, so the chain is always a simple, walked path from the
 * spawn tile to here: no walls on it, whatever the map. A carrier whose delivery stalls (Cfg.TRAIL) walks it back,
 * each turn to the free neighbour earliest on the chain, which also cuts corners where the chain passes close to
 * itself. A jump of more than one tile (carried, thrown) starts a new chain where the rat lands.
