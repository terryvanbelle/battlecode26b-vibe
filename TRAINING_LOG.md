# Training log (append-only; one entry per attempt or foundation step, newest last)

## F0 foundation, 2026-10-27 22:54 PDT
- Engine 1.2.6 pinned; RULES.md engine digest (24 spec/engine disagreements); map census (74 maps).
- Runner tools/arena.py (VM, unshare -rn, slot semaphore, code-hash keyed rows); ReplayDump; game_report.py.
- ratbot v0: G/Sym/Comms/Nav/King/Baby, cat traps, compute monitor.
- Basics battery vs examplefuncsplayer (never spawns, starves ~r1310), all 74 maps x both sides:
  - v0b (runs/v0b_vs_ex): 131-17. Losses: king starved (no deliveries: rats never faced the king; king boxed in
    dirt on EscapeTheNight and closeup; king never heard squeaks because it acts before its babies).
  - Fixes: dig toward target, face king to deliver, read previous-round squeaks, king digs blocked spawn ring,
    bug-nav start heading (unit test caught a 2x2 orbit).
