# Training log (append-only; one entry per attempt or foundation step, newest last)

## F0 foundation, 2026-10-27 22:54 PDT
- Engine 1.2.6 pinned; RULES.md engine digest (24 spec/engine disagreements); map census (74 maps).
- Runner tools/arena.py (VM, unshare -rn, slot semaphore, code-hash keyed rows); ReplayDump; game_report.py.
- ratbot v0: G/Sym/Comms/Nav/King/Baby, cat traps, compute monitor.
- Basics battery vs examplefuncsplayer (never spawns, starves ~r1310), all 74 maps x both sides:
  - v0b (runs/v0b_vs_ex): 131-17. Losses: king starved (no deliveries: rats never faced the king; king boxed in
    dirt on EscapeTheNight and closeup; king never heard squeaks because it acts before its babies).
  - Fixes: dig toward target, face king to deliver, read previous-round squeaks, king digs blocked spawn ring,
    bug-nav start heading (unit test caught a 2x2 orbit).

## F1 economy budget + field, 2026-10-27 23:45 PDT
- v0c/v0d batteries vs example: 130-18, then 134-14 (nav orbit fix, digRing, stand-off delivery: coin flips gone).
- Remaining losses: our king died first. The example never spawns: its king just eats the starting ~2500 cheese.
  Ours either starved (spent on spawns/traps, income < upkeep on cat-heavy maps) or was killed by a cat.
- v0e Econ (spawn only while projected end cheese at 75% of measured income stays positive; traps/cheese bites
  gated on the kings' published surplus): **98-50, much worse**. Cause: early traps blocked, so cats killed our king
  before the example's. Lesson: cat damage near our king is survival, not luxury (see LEARNINGS 6).
- v0f: traps allowed on a 300-cheese floor whenever the cat is within dist2 100 of our king (battery running).
- Field: 64 repos scanned (no hostile code), 1,057 packages compiled; 56 chosen by package name (finals/quals/latest)
  -> research/field/FIELD.tsv; 53 seeded on the replica ladder (tools/galaxy26/field-teams.tsv), activity + autoscrim on.
- Gauntlet s0e vs the top 5 (partial, 80 games): **0-80**. Every loss is RATKING_DESTROYED by a rush: backstab at
  round 13-36, 20-60 king bites, rat traps 10-80, throws 20-140, our rats die one-for-one with our spawns.
  Our babies never moved toward an enemy. Combat is the missing basic.
- s0g war mode: babies bite the best adjacent enemy (king first, then lowest HP; turn to face), close on visible
  enemies once cooperation ends, answer a king's alert slot; the king spawns freely toward enemies under attack.
